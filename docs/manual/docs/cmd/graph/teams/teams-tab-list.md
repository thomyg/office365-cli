## Remarks

To list available tabs in a specific Microsoft Teams channel, you have to first log in to the Microsoft Graph using the [graph login](../login.md) command, eg. `graph login`.

You can only retrieve tabs for teams of which you are a member.

Tabs _Conversations_ and _Files_ are present in every team and therefore not included in the list of available tabs.
